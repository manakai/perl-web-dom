=head1 NAME

Web::DOM::TouchList - The DOM |TouchList| object

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<Web::DOM::TouchList> class implements the DOM C<TouchList>
interface.

=head1 METHODS

Following methods are available:

=over 4

=item $touch = $list->[$index]

=item $touch = $list->item ($index)

Return the L<Web::DOM::Touch> object in the list, specified by its
index.  [TOUCH] [DOMPERL]

Use of the C<item> method is discouraged as it doesn't support
Perl-ish ways to access items, such as negative indexing, while C<<
$list->[-1] >> works as intended.

=item $number = @$list

=item $number = $list->length

Return the number of the touches in the list.  [TOUCH] [DOMPERL]

=item $arrayref = $list->to_a

Return the new static array reference containing the touches in the
list.  [DOMPERL]

=item ($touch1, $touch2, ...) = $list->to_list

=item ($touch1, $touch2, ...) = @$list

Return the list of the L<Web::DOM::Touch>es contained in the list.
[DOMPERL]

=back

The object supports Perl standard read-only operations for array
references, e.g. C<< exists $rule_list->[4] >>.  [DOMPERL]
