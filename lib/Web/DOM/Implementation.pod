=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<Web::DOM::Implementation> class implements the DOM

The class has following methods:

=over 4

=item $impl = Web::DOM::Implementation->new

Create a new instance of the C<DOMImplementation> object.  This method
is provided for some kind of compatibility and should not be used with
newer applications.  Now that the L<Web::DOM::Document> class has the
constructor, the constructor method of the L<Web::DOM::Implementation>
class is useless. [DOMPERL]

=item $doc = $impl->create_document ($nsurl, $qname, $doctype)

Create a new L<Web::DOM::XMLDocument>.  [DOM]

If first and second arguments are specified, they are used as the
namespace URL and the qualified name of the document element.  If they
are not specified, an empty document is created.

If the third argument is specified, it is used as the document type
node of the document.
